Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016) Health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Indicators 1990-2030

The Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016), coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), estimated the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors from 1990 to 2016.

The United Nations established, in September 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which specify 17 universal goals, 169 targets, and 232 indicators leading up to 2030. Drawing from GBD 2016, this dataset provides estimates for 37 health-related SDG indicators for 188 countries from 1990 to 2016, as well as projections, based on past trends, from 2017 to 2030. These 37 SDG indicators were used to construct the health-related SDG index, a summary measure of overall performance across the health-related SDGs.

The results were published in The Lancet in September 2017 in "Measuring progress and projecting attainment based on past trends of the health-related Sustainable Development Goals in 188 countries: an analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016."
